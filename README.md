BCAN Building Emissions Data Visualization Project
This repository contains the data analysis and visualizations developed for the Boston Climate Action Network (BCAN) project. The goal was to analyze building emissions data to reveal energy trends and BERDO compliance, supporting targeted policy recommendations.

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize building emissions data from Boston's most populated areas to uncover energy usage trends and ensure compliance with the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance (BERDO). The visualizations highlight high-emission properties to support targeted policy recommendations.

Contents
SQL Query: Contains the SQL queries used for data extraction and processing (SeanRyanSQLQuery.sql).
Data Files: Includes the processed data files used for analysis and visualization (ActualFinalSR.csv).
Visualizations: Screenshots of the developed visualizations showcasing energy usage trends (Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 10.49.04 AM.png, Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 10.48.02 AM.png, Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 10.47.57 AM.png).
Data Analysis
The analysis involved:

Extracting building emissions data using SQL queries.
Processing and cleaning the data for accurate analysis.
Identifying trends and patterns in energy usage over the years 2015-2023.
Evaluating compliance with BERDO regulations.
Visualizations
Interactive visualizations were developed to illustrate:

Total energy usage (kBTU) from 2015 to 2023 for the most populated areas in Boston.
Energy usage by property types in Boston.
High-emission properties, supporting targeted policy recommendations.
Requirements
To replicate the analysis and visualizations, you will need the following tools:

SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for running the provided queries.
Data visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Python libraries like matplotlib, seaborn).
How to Use
Load Data: Import the data files into your SQL database.
Run Queries: Execute the provided SQL queries to extract and process the data.
Visualize: Use a data visualization tool to create visualizations based on the processed data.
Example Visualizations
